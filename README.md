# Flock

Flock is a group travel planning app for long-distance friends. It generates the cheapest destinations for all individuals based on their different cities and budgets, provides activity search, real-time drag-and-drop “Idea Board” and scheduler for group collaboration, and produces an interactive map showing daily routes based on activity selection.

Built as a group capstone project at Fullstack Academy.
